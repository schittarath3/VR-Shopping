# VR-Shopping

HackGT9 Project.

## Inspiration💡
Our inspiration is two pronged. We believe in both customers and small business owners. 

### Customers 👴🧓
Instacart provides a way to shop groceries conveniently, but lacks the familiarity of browsing a grocery store. We believe that people who do not have access to grocery stores due to lack of mobility can find ease in shopping at home in a virtual environment. Users will be able to interact with products, like checking quality, size, etc., before purchasing it. 

### Small Business Owners 🏪
Small business owners can also benefit from this product by not having to purchase or lease real estate, often the largest expense of a business owner. Instead, business owners can open a virtual shop using only server costs at a fraction of real estate costs. By having a virtual shop, we offer business owners a way to showcase their products outside of the tradition web and mobile platforms. However, owners can opt to design their virtual shop however they like.

## What it does ⚙️
By trading an app UI for virtual reality, we aim to bring a convenient way to shop at a store remotely. Shopping is done completely virtual through a VR set or a phone VR kit. We provide interactions with grocery items and a simple checkout system. 

## How we built it 🛠
We used Unity to build a prototype grocery store for navigation and to integrate VR 🥽 for user interactions with the grocery store. We also used Figma for creating mockups on this DevPost.

## What’s Next ⏭
We hope to also extend the simulator to incorporate challenges. Fastest checkout, memorization challenges, etc. Maybe even an esports league for grocery shopping. The possibilities are endless!
